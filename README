* Ormchair
Is an ORM for Apache CouchDB, with the following main features: 
- Support for document linking (many to many)
- Ability to export the schema as JSON-Schema compatiable json, ideal for frontend validation
- Create and query views based on a simple index, without the need to create JS views
- Versioning and tagging of schema changes, so that migrates between versions can be done
