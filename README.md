Ormchair
=========


#### Is an ORM for Apache CouchDB, with the following killer features: 

- Uses [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
- Support for document linking and retrieval (many to many) with secondary indexes to query more easily
- Ability to export the schema as [JSON-Schema](http://json-schema.org/) compatiable json, ideal for frontend validation
- Create and query views based on a simple index, without the need to create JS views
- Versioning and tagging of schema changes, so that migrates between versions can be done
- Automatic synchronisation of design documents based on defined classes


#### Features yet to be implemented:

- Attachments
- Replication
